abstract: |
  Psychological science is facing a crisis of confidence fueled by concerns about replicability of empirical findings (e.g., Open Science Collaboration, 2015).
  In response, psychologists have been reviewing how they do research and are leading many initiatives to improve replicability.
  A fundamental element is greater transparency and intersubjective verifiability:
  Researchers increasingly publish research materials, data and analysis scripts, publicly preregister their studies, and share and discuss preprints.
  The evolving open science ecosystem provides a variety of tools and services to help researchers adopt transparent research practices.
  However, setting up a transparent research workflow involves a plethora of decisions that can be off-putting.
  Fortunately, transparent research practices can be adopted piecemeal---each incremental step adds positive value for individual researchers and the credibility of psychological research.
  This active workshop will walk participants through the process of preparing and sharing their research products, including materials, data, analysis scripts, and study protocols.
  It will address what, when, and how to share and help participants develop transparent, less error-prone, and more reproducible research workflows.

# Course outline

The active three-hour workshop will cover the following issues.


### Conceptual introduction

- Why share? (brief, participants already signed up for the workshop)
    - Good for others
    - Good for you
        - In-lab transparency
        - Paul Wilson quote

- It's just documenting your work, making it easier to understand (for yourself and others)
    - So that lab members can learn from each other
    - So that you don't forget what you've done
    - So that your colleagues can help your work flourish
- Has the bonus of allowing you to share outside, if/when you want


- What to share?
    - Show some example data set documentation (maybe `codebook` package?, https://osf.io/rv7py/, https://osf.io/e4tqy/)
    - Demonstrate dynamic documents

- When to share?
    - data
        - during data collection: Set up Dropbox to collect born-open data
        - before/together with submission: e.g., institutional or public repository
        - after publication: repository, personal or journal website
        - after end of project: same options as after publication
    - papers
        - preregistration
            - Show some preregistration websites, showcase good preregistrations (https://osf.io/h9k8n/)
        - upon submission (preprint)
        - upon acceptance (postprint)
            - http://www.sherpa.ac.uk/romeo/search.php

- How to share?
    - Data
        - Handout table that summarizes repositories
            - Discuss some use cases (maybe suggested by participants)
        - Browse example OSF repository
        - Hand out DGPs model informed consent
        - Citeable datasets
        - GDPR (see Arslan slides)
    - papers
        - Say something about PsyArXiv vs. BioArXiv vs. PeerJ vs. ...
        - PsyArXiv: Official partner of APA (http://www.apa.org/pubs/authors/unauthorized-internet-posting.aspx)
        
        - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_academic_journals_by_preprint_policy (not an exhaustive list)
Only two that explicitly rule out preprints
            - NEJM [New England Journal of Medicine] and JCI [Journal of Clinical Investigation]

- Why not to share?
    - Brief discussion of DSGVO? (Anonymisation example?)
    - Examples of sensitive data (from participants)

- Incentivize sharing
    - PRO initiative
    - Commitment to Research Transparency and Open Science (http://www.researchtransparency.org/)
    - practical advantages for researchers (find your own data, more citations...)

- How can you promote research transparency?
    - use templates for transparent & reproducible projects
    - share materials with your collaborators
    - teach your students and colleagues
        - What do we do here in Cologne?
        - Example: Registered Report draft as non-empirical Bachelor's thesis
    - vote with you feet
        - Choose journals that value openness/robustness over falshy journals
    - Incentives
        - Take openness into account when particpating in commissions or writing job ads
    - Give credit where credit is due (cite data, open source or free software developed by academics, etc.)
