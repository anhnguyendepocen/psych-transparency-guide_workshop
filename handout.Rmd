> do not let the perfect be the enemy of the good. Share
and document what you can, as it will provide a benefit
compared with not sharing (p. 4, Klein et al., 2018).

# General considerations

- Make transparency a default
    - Make documentation and sharing a by-product of the lab workflow
    - If possible, share all products of the research process
    - If negative constraints prohibit transparency, explicitly declare and justify these decisions in the manuscript
    - Automate what can be automated

- Making your workflow play well with the rest of the lab?
    - Do not impose
    - Compromise surely necessary

# What can you share?

- Amnesia test: Would I understand this tomorrow if I lost my memory?
- Learn and improve system based on experience with previous projects


- Study protocol
    - Recepie for replication
    - Collates, describes, and organises more specific research products, e.g.,
        - Hypotheses
        - Study materials
        - Instructive video footage of procedure (https://www.jove.com/)
    <!-- - May be more detailed than published description -->
    <!-- - Facilitates scientific progress (e.g., replication and extension) -->

- Study material
    - Can be anything necessary to conduct the study, e.g.,
        - Questionnaires
        - Stimuli
        - Computer code to present stimuli and collect responses
        - Procedures for an interaction with a confederate
    - Video documentation of procedure
        - OBS
        - JoVE
    <!-- - Aids interpretation of results -->
    <!-- - Facilitates scientific progress (e.g., replication and extension) -->

- Data & Metadata
    - Raw data
        - As originally recoreded (e.g., paper-pencil-questionaires, CSV files, video recordings)
    - Processed data
        - As used for analyses (e.g., coded, digitized, merged)
    - Protect privacy of participants (identifying and sensitive information)
        - Directly identifying information (e.g., Full name, Address (post or email), Passport number, Face, fingerprints, or handwriting, Credit card numbers, Date of birth, Genetic information)
        - Personal data: Anything that can be attributed to a specific person (even with help of additional data sets)

> In the EU General Data Protection Regulation, this has been
formalized in Article 4: a "data subject" is one "who can be
identified, directly or indirectly, by means reasonably likely to be
used by the controller or by any other natural or legal person".

        - Anonymisation vs. Pseudonymisation
            - Store demographic data used for sample description separately and in an unlinkable manner
            - Binning
            - Top and bottom coding
            - Adding noise
            - Remove free text entries
            - Aggregation
        - GDPR (https://iapp.org/news/a/how-gdpr-changes-the-rules-for-research/)
        - Informed consent
        - Harm assessment?
        - Risk of reidentification
            - Small population
            - Rare traits
            - Couples, families, class mates, co-workers
            - Genetic, brain, geographic data
        - Who will the data be shared with?
        - Are participants unique in the sample and population?
        - Self-identification??? <!-- TODO: How is this a problem/How would it be possible to prevent this? -->
        - Motivate intruder test?
            - Jealous partner, nosy neighbor, co-worker, journalist, insurers, marketers, blackmailers
        - Collect only data you really need
        - Delete indentying information used for logistics
    - Use open and interoperable file formats (e.g., CSV)
    - Metadata
        - Dataset documentation
        - Who collected the data how and when
        - Number of observations
        - Variable and value labels
        - Simple codebooks vs. standardized and machine-readable (services provided by repositories)
            <!-- This documentation should describe the variables in each data file in both human- and machine-readable formats (e.g., csv, rather than docx or pdf).4 Ideally, codebooks are organized in such a way that each line represents one variable and each information relative to a variable represents a column. -->
            <!-- Codebooks should include the following information for each variable: the name, description of the variable, units of measurement, coding of values (e.g., “1 = Female”,”2 = Male”), possible options or range in which the data points can fall (e.g., “1 = not at all to 7 = Very much”), value(s) used for missing values, and information on whether and how the variable was derived from other variables in the dataset (e.g., “bmi was derived from body_weight m and body_height l as BMI = m/l^2 .”). Other relevant information in a codebook entry can include the source of a measure, instructions for a questionnaire item, information about translation, or scale that an item belongs to. -->
    - FAIR
    - https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00031305.2017.1375987
    
    - **Demonstration**: Show examples (https://osf.io/rv7py/, https://osf.io/e4tqy/), show `codebook` package and [SPSS codebook function](https://libguides.library.kent.edu/SPSS/Codebooks)
        <!-- - Codebooks can be generated from the data set metadata in popular statistical software, including SPSS (http://libguides.library.kent.edu/SPSS/Codebooks), Stata (http://www.stata.com/manuals13/dcodebook.pdf), or R (http://www.martin-elff.net/knitr/memisc/codebook.html; https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/codebook/index.html), or with data publishing tools (e.g., http://www.nesstar.com/software/publisher.html), also see https://datawiz.leibniz-psychology.org/
. The author of the codebook (Arslan, 2018) package for R has also created a web app for creating codebooks for SPSS, Stata or RDS files: https://rubenarslan.ocpu.io/codebook/www/ -->

# When can you share?

> When it comes to the question of when to share, any time
is better than never  (p. 4, Klein et al., 2018).

- Planning to share
    - Have a basic data management plan ([Jones, 2011](http://www.dcc.ac.uk/resources/how-guides), https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/content/datamanagement/dmp/framework.html, http://www.dcc.ac.uk/sites/default/files/documents/resource/DMP/DMP-checklist-flyer.pdf) <!-- TODO: Can we give a simple example here? Provide additional guidance? -->
        - Examples: https://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk/public_plans
        - Project structure
    - Simplifies addressing legal and ethical issues
    - Reduces extra effort associated with sharing

- Before data collection
    - Study protocol
    - Study material
    - Analysis scripts
        - Standard operating procedures
    - Formal time-stamped preregistration or not
    - [Registered reports](https://cos.io/rr/)
    - how to pre-register via the OSF, see https://osf.io/2vu7m/

- During data collection
    - Study protocol
    - Study material
    - Analysis scripts
    - Raw data

        - Possible errors can be spotted early on (no public correction)
    - Demonstrates dedication to openness
    - [OSF view-only links](http://help.osf.io/m/links_forks/l/524049-create-a-view-only-link-for-a-project)
    

- After an embargo
    - Archive in public respository, but publish later
    - Allows further analyses of dataset and investigation of research question
    - Reduces extra effort associated with sharing

- Study protocol

- Study material, data & metadata
    - Choose a suitable public repository
        1. Uses persistent and unique identifiers for products (such as DOIs).
        2. Accommodates structured metadata to maximize discoverability and reuse.
        3. Tracks data re-use (e.g., citations, download counts).
        4. Accommodates licensing (e.g., provides the ability to place legal restrictions on data reuse or signal there are no restrictions).
        5. Features access controls (e.g., allows restriction of access to a particular set of users).
        6. Has some persistence guarantees for long-term access.
        7. Stores data in accordance with local legislation (e.g., the new General Data Protection Regulation for the EU, http://www.eugdpr.org/).
    - Data & meta data
        - Protect participant privacy!
    - Public != free to use
    - Adhere to copyright and licensing regulations
    - Explicitly apply permissive license
        - Use easy-to-understand standard licenses

# How you can promote openness?

- Incentivize sharing
    - PRO initiative
    - Commitment to Research Transparency and Open Science (http://www.researchtransparency.org/)
    - practical advantages for researchers (find your own data, more citations...)

- How can you promote research transparency?
    - use templates for transparent & reproducible projects
    - share materials with your collaborators
    - teach your students and colleagues
        - What do we do here in Cologne?
        - Example: Registered Report draft as non-empirical Bachelor's thesis
    - vote with you feet
        - Choose journals that value openness/robustness over falshy journals
    - Incentives
        - Take openess into account when particpating in commissions (https://osf.io/7jbnt/)
    - Give credit where credit is due (cite data, open source software developed by academics, etc.)


- Why not to share?
    - Brief discussion of DSGVO? (Anonymisation example?)
    - Examples of sensitive data (from participants)
    - Scooping
        - Usually an unwarranted fear
        - Publish upon acceptance or with an embargo
    - I could be wrong
        - Errors are inevitable
        - Promotes scientific self-correction
        - Errors will become a normal part of science
        - Constructive self-correction will improve scholars' standing (Fetterman & Sassenberg, 2015)
    - Time-consuming
        - Take one step at a time ("baby steps")
        - Open science == good research management practices
            - Increases efficency in the long-run
        - Increases exposure and citations
        - Helps to avoid fruitless avenues for future studies
