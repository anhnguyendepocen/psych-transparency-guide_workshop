- Mention re3data.org
- Mention OpenSesame, Lab.js, jsPsych


# General considerations

> do not let the perfect be the enemy of the good. Share
and document what you can, as it will provide a benefit
compared with not sharing (p. 4, Klein et al., 2018).

- Make transparency a default
    - Make documentation and sharing a by-product of the lab workflow
        - If possible, share all products of the research process
        - If negative constraints prohibit transparency, explicitly declare and justify these decisions in the manuscript
    - Automate what can be automated

<!-- - Making your workflow play well with the rest of the lab? -->
<!--     - Do not impose -->
<!--     - Compromise surely necessary -->


# What can you share?

- Learn and improve system based on experience with previous projects
- _Amnesia test_ (Could I still understand this if I lost my memory?)

```{r figure1, fig.cap = "Decision flowchart outlining important considerations when sharing research products."}
include_graphics("images/klein-et-al-figure-1.png")
```


## Study protocol

- Recepie for replication
- Collates, describes, and organises more specific research products
    - Hypotheses
    - Study materials
    - Detailed description of procedure
        - Instructive video documentation
    
<!-- - May be more detailed than published description -->
<!-- - Facilitates scientific progress (e.g., replication and extension) -->


## Study materials

- Anything necessary to conduct the study, e.g.,
    - Questionnaires
    - Stimulus material
    - Computer code to present stimuli and collect responses
    - Procedures for an interaction with a confederate

- Mind intellectual property rights

    <!-- TODO: Anything else? -->
    
<!-- - Aids interpretation of results -->
<!-- - Facilitates scientific progress (e.g., replication and extension) -->


## Data

- Include information about data sharing in informed consent
- Use open and interoperable file formats (e.g., CSV, TSV, ODS)
    - Use UTF-8 character encoding

<!-- https://twitter.com/dutchscientist/status/898938100008845313 -->

- Raw data
    - As originally recoreded (e.g., paper-pencil-questionaires, CSV files, video recordings)

- Processed data
    - As used for analyses (e.g., coded, digitized, merged)
    - Ideally "tidy" datasets
        1. Each measured variable in one column.
        2. Different observation of the variables in a different rows
        3. Multiple tables should include a column that allows them to be linked
    
    <!-- https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00031305.2017.1375987 -->

<!-- - **Demonstration**: Show examples (https://osf.io/rv7py/, https://osf.io/e4tqy/), show `codebook` package and [SPSS codebook function](https://libguides.library.kent.edu/SPSS/Codebooks) -->
<!-- The author of the codebook (Arslan, 2018) package for R has also created a web app for creating codebooks for SPSS, Stata or RDS files: https://rubenarslan.ocpu.io/codebook/www/ -->

- Participant privacy
    - EU GDPR: Data are personal if attributable to a specific person (using additional datasets if necessary)
        - [IAPP: How GDPR changes the rules for research](https://iapp.org/news/a/how-gdpr-changes-the-rules-for-research/)
    - Only share anonymized data publicly, e.g.
        - Delete directly identifying information (e.g., full name, address, face, handwriting, date of birth, genetic information)
        - Separate demographic used for sample description and study data
        - Remove free text entries
        - If necessary, transform data, e.g.
            - Binning
            - Top and bottom coding
            - Add noise
            - Aggregation
    - Exert access control over pseudonomyzed data 
    
    <!-- - Harm assessment? -->
    
    - Assess risk of reidentification, e.g.
        - Small population
        - Rare traits
        - Dyadic data
        - Hierarchical data (e.g., small subsamples of students, co-workers)
        - Self-identification??? <!-- TODO: How is this a problem/How would it be possible to prevent this? -->
        - _Motivate intruder test_ (e.g., jealous partner, noisy neighbor, envious co-worker, insurers, blackmailers)
    <!-- - Who will the data be shared with? -->
    - Collect only data you need
    - Delete indentying information used for logistics as soon as possible

> To determine whether a natural person is identifiable, account should be taken of all the means reasonably likely to be used, such as singling out, either by the controller or by another person to identify the natural person directly or indirectly.
<br /><br />
To ascertain whether means are reasonably likely to be used to identify the natural person, account should be taken of all objective factors, such as the costs of and the amount of time required for identification, taking into consideration the available technology at the time of the processing and technological developments. (Recital 26 EU GDPR)


## Metadata

- Sampling procedure (Who collected the data how, when, and where)
- Dataset, e.g.
    - Number of observations
    - Name and description of variables (incl. source of a measure, information about translation)
    - Units of measurement, coding of values (e.g., “1 = Female”,”2 = Male”), possible options or range in which the data points can fall (e.g., “1 = not at all to 7 = Very much”)
    - Value(s) used for missing data
    - If necessary, how a variable was derived from other variables (e.g., "`bmi` was derived from body weight `m` and height `l` as $\mathrm{BMI} = m/l^2$.")
- Automate codebook generation
    - Analysis software(e.g., [R `codebook` package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/codebook/index.html), [SPSS codebook function](https://libguides.library.kent.edu/SPSS/Codebooks), or [Stata codebook function](http://www.stata.com/manuals13/dcodebook.pdf))
    - Specialized software (e.g., [Nesstar](http://www.nesstar.com/software/publisher.html), [DataWiz](https://datawiz.leibniz-psychology.org/DataWiz/?datawiz_locale=en))
- If data are complex and have potentially high reuse value, consider using a standardized and machine-readable format
    - Implementation is a service provided by some repositories
    <!-- This documentation should describe the variables in each data file in both human- and machine-readable formats (e.g., csv, rather than docx or pdf).4 Ideally, codebooks are organized in such a way that each line represents one variable and each information relative to a variable represents a column. -->

## Standard operating procedures

- Describe a group's default practices in data analysis (e.g., [SOP for Green lab at Columbia](http://alexandercoppock.com/Green-Lab-SOP/Green_Lab_SOP.pdf))
- Simplifies authoring of preregistrations

<!-- https://doi.org/10.1017/S1049096516000810) -->


## Documentation of analyses

- Exact specification of how to move from raw data to reported results (including cleaning or transformation of data)
    - Step-by-step description of analyses performed in non-scriptable software programs
    - Analysis software syntax
- Documentation of computational environment (hardware and software used for analyses)
- Avoid "works on my machine" errors
    - Relative file paths or load data from a permanent online source
    - Avoid spaces and special characters
    - Test on another computer
    - Use cloud-based platforms (e.g., [Code Ocean](https://codeocean.com/), [RStudio cloud](https://rstudio.cloud/), [Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/))
- Share intermediate results for complex analyses
- Set and record seeds for pseudorandom number generators
- Use open source software


## Research reports

- If published behind paywall, preprint or postprint (see journal policy, e.g., [SHERPA/RoMEO](http://www.sherpa.ac.uk/romeo/search.php))
- If gold open access, final version of manuscript



# When can you share?

> When it comes to the question of when to share, any time
is better than never  (p. 4, Klein et al., 2018).


## Planning to share

- Have a basic data management plan ([Jones, 2011](http://www.dcc.ac.uk/resources/how-guides), https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/content/datamanagement/dmp/framework.html, http://www.dcc.ac.uk/sites/default/files/documents/resource/DMP/DMP-checklist-flyer.pdf) <!-- TODO: Can we give a simple example here? Provide additional guidance? -->
    - Examples: https://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk/public_plans
    - Project structure
- Simplifies addressing legal and ethical issues
- Reduces extra effort associated with sharing

## Before data collection

- Study protocol
- Study material
- Analysis scripts
    - Standard operating procedures
- Formal time-stamped preregistration or not
- [Registered reports](https://cos.io/rr/)
- how to pre-register via the OSF, see https://osf.io/2vu7m/

## During data collection

- Study protocol
- Study material
- Analysis scripts
- Raw data
    - Born-open data
        - Automatically uploaded to a public repository
            - Reduces extra effort associated with sharing
        - Offsite backup
        - Protect participants' privacy!
        - [Born-open data with cloud storage providers](http://psych-transparency-guide.uni-koeln.de/born-open-data.html)

## Upon paper submission (or upon publication)

- Recommended (vs. paper publication)
- Allows thorough evaluation of research
    - Possible errors can be spotted early on (no public correction)
- Demonstrates dedication to openness
- [OSF view-only links](http://help.osf.io/m/links_forks/l/524049-create-a-view-only-link-for-a-project)
    

## After an embargo

- Archive in public respository, but publish later
- Allows further analyses of dataset and investigation of research question
- Reduces extra effort associated with sharing

- Study protocol
- Study material
- Data & Metadata
    - Born-open data
        - **Demonstration**: Set up Dropbox to collect born-open data <!-- TODO: Johannes, ist das eher when oder how? -->
- Analysis scripts
    - Demonstrate dynamic documents

```{r figure2, fig.cap = "Typical workflow indicating when to share research products at different stages of the research process."}
include_graphics("images/klein-et-al-figure-2.png")
```


# How can you share?

## Project structure and naming scheme

- See example project
    - Protocol/Preregistration
    - Materials
    - Raw data
    - Processed data
    - Analysis
    - Research report

- For better access control use components or encrypt (https://medium.com/@richarddmorey/hiding-in-plain-sight-16b275b91625)!

- Exert access control over pseudonomyzed data 
    - Share in access restricted repository
    - Publicly share encrypted data


## Study protocol

- Preregistration
    - **Demonstration**: Show some preregistration websites, showcase good preregistrations (https://osf.io/h9k8n/)
    
- Registered report

- Instructive video footage of procedure
    - Screencapturing computer experiments (e.g., [OBS](https://obsproject.com/))
    - [JoVE Behavior](https://www.jove.com/journal/behavior)


## Study material, data & metadata

- Choose a suitable public repository
    1. Uses persistent and unique identifiers for products (such as DOIs).
    2. Accommodates structured metadata to maximize discoverability and reuse.
    3. Tracks data re-use (e.g., citations, download counts).
    4. Accommodates licensing (e.g., provides the ability to place legal restrictions on data reuse or signal there are no restrictions).
    5. Features access controls (e.g., allows restriction of access to a particular set of users).
    6. Has some persistence guarantees for long-term access.
    7. Stores data in accordance with local legislation (e.g., the new General Data Protection Regulation for the EU, http://www.eugdpr.org/).
- Data & meta data
    - Protect participant privacy!
- Public != free to use
- Explicitly apply permissive license
    - Use easy-to-understand standard licenses
        - [Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/)
        - [Open data commons](https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/)
        - Simply include a license statement in a text file ("All files in this repository are licensed under a Creative Commons Zero License (CC0 1.0)")
    - Recommendations
        - Public domain, CC0 and ODC-PDDL
        - Condition re-use only on attribution, CC-BY and ODC-BY

<!-- TODO: Tabelle 1 hier unterbringen -->
<!-- TODO: Johannes, sollten wir hier Informationen aus der Tabelle von Meyer, 2018 ergänzen oder ist das redundant? -->

    - Hand out DGPs model informed consent
    - Handout table that summarizes repositories
        - Discuss some usecases (maybe suggested by participants)
    - Repository structure
        - **Demonstration**: Browse example OSF repository
    - Citeable datasets
    - FAIR


## Analysis scripts

- Briefly note some best practices
- **Demonstrate**: Dynamic documents (`papaja`)


## Reports

- Say something about PsyArXiv vs. BioArXiv vs. PeerJ vs. ...
- PsyArXiv: Official partner of APA (http://www.apa.org/pubs/authors/unauthorized-internet-posting.aspx)
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_academic_journals_by_preprint_policy (not an exhaustive list)
Only two that explicitly rule out preprints
    - NEJM [New England Journal of Medicine] and JCI [Journal of Clinical Investigation]

(https://nikokriegeskorte.org/2016/03/13/the-selfish-scientists-guide-to-preprint-posting/, https://archaeologicalnetworks.wordpress.com/2017/09/28/open-science-in-archaeology-publication-and-special-interest-group/)
    - upon submission (preprint)
    - upon acceptance (postprint)
        - http://www.sherpa.ac.uk/romeo/search.php

- Green open access
    - preprint repositories, like [PsyArXiv](https://psyarxiv.com/), [BioArXiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/)
    - Usually not considered "prior publication" (Bourne, Polka, Vale, &
Kiley, 2017)
- Gold open access
    - Open publication by publisher


## Licenses

# How you can promote openness?

## Incentivize sharing

- [PRO initiative](https://opennessinitiative.org/)
- [Commitment to Research Transparency and Open Science](http://www.researchtransparency.org/)
- Practical advantages for researchers (find your own data, more citations...)


## How can you promote research transparency?

- use templates for transparent & reproducible projects
- share materials with your collaborators
- teach your students and colleagues
    - What do we do here in Cologne?
    - Example: Registered Report draft as non-empirical Bachelor's thesis
- vote with you feet
    - Choose journals that value openness/robustness over falshy journals
- Incentives
    - Take openess into account when particpating in commissions (https://osf.io/7jbnt/)
- Give credit where credit is due (cite data, open source software developed by academics, etc.)


## Why not to share?

- Brief discussion of DSGVO? (Anonymisation example?)
- Examples of sensitive data (from participants)
- Scooping
    - Usually an unwarranted fear
    - Publish upon acceptance or with an embargo
- I could be wrong
    - Errors are inevitable
    - Promotes scientific self-correction
    - Errors will become a normal part of science
    - Constructive self-correction will improve scholars' standing (Fetterman & Sassenberg, 2015)
- Time-consuming
    - Take one step at a time ("baby steps")
    - Open science == good research management practices
        - Increases efficency in the long-run
    - Increases exposure and citations
    - Helps to avoid fruitless avenues for future studies
