# General considerations

> do not let the perfect be the enemy of the good. Share
and document what you can, as it will provide a benefit
compared with not sharing (p. 4, Klein et al., 2018).

- Make transparency a default
    - Make documentation and sharing a by-product of the lab workflow
        - If possible, share all products of the research process (as early as possible)
        - If negative constraints prohibit transparency, explicitly declare and justify these decisions (in publications)
- Automate what can be automated
- Create and use templates

    
<!-- - Reduces extra sharing efforts -->

<!-- - Making your workflow play well with the rest of the lab? -->
<!--     - Do not impose -->
<!--     - Compromise surely necessary -->


# What can you share?

- Improve your workflow based on experience with previous projects
- _Amnesia test_ (Could I still understand this if I lost my memory?)

## Study protocol

- Recipe for replication
- Collates, describes, and organises more specific research products
    - Hypotheses
    - Study materials
    - Detailed description of procedure
        - Instructive video documentation (e.g., [OBS](https://obsproject.com/) for computer-based studies)

        <!-- - __Demonstration:__ OBS -->
    
<!-- - May be more detailed than published description -->
<!-- - Facilitates scientific progress (e.g., replication and extension) -->


## Study materials

- Anything necessary to conduct the study, e.g.,
    - Questionnaires
    - Stimulus material
    - Computer code to present stimuli and collect responses
    - Instructions for interaction with participants
    - potentially also scripts/instructions for confederates

- Mind intellectual property rights!

    <!-- TODO: Anything else? -->
    
<!-- - Aids interpretation of results -->
<!-- - Facilitates scientific progress (e.g., replication and extension) -->


## Data

- Include information about data sharing in informed consent (see [our informed consent templates](http://psych-transparency-guide.uni-koeln.de//informed-consent.html))
- Use open and interoperable file formats (e.g., CSV, TSV, JSON, ODS)
    - Use UTF-8 character encoding

<!-- https://twitter.com/dutchscientist/status/898938100008845313 -->

- Raw data
    - As originally recorded (e.g., paper-pencil-questionaires, CSV files, video recordings)

- Processed data
    - As used for analyses (e.g., coded, digitized, merged)
    - Ideally "Tidy Data" ([Wickham, 2014 ](https://www.jstatsoft.org/index.php/jss/article/view/v059i10/v59i10.pdf))
        1. Each measured variable in one column.
        2. Different observation of the variables in a different rows
        3. Multiple tables should include a column that allows them to be linked

- Participant privacy
    - [EU GDPR](http://www.eugdpr.org/): Data are personal if attributable to a specific person (using additional datasets if necessary)
        - [IAPP: How GDPR changes the rules for research](https://iapp.org/news/a/how-gdpr-changes-the-rules-for-research/)

    - Only collect the data you really need
    - Delete indentying information used for logistics as soon as possible (e.g., e-mail addresses)
    - Only share anonymized data publicly, e.g.,
        - Delete directly identifying information (e.g., full name, address, face, handwriting, date of birth, genetic information)
            - Mind combinations of indirect identifiers (e.g., ZIP code, gender, and date of birth, [Sweeney, 2000](https://dataprivacylab.org/projects/identifiability/paper1.pdf))
        - Separate demographics used for sample description and study data
        - Remove free text entries and potentially also alter them when citing in publications
        - If necessary, transform data, e.g.,
            - Binning
            - Top and bottom coding
            - Add noise
            - Aggregation
        - Use anonymization tools (e.g., [ARX](http://arx.deidentifier.org/), [Amnesia](https://amnesia.openaire.eu/index.html))
    - Control access to pseudonymized data 
    
    <!-- - Harm assessment? -->
    
    - Assess risk of reidentification, e.g.,
        - Small population and rare traits
        - Dyadic data
        - Hierarchical data (e.g., small subsamples of students, co-workers)
        - Self-identification??? <!-- TODO: How is this a problem/How would it be possible to prevent this? -->
        - _Motivated intruder test_ (e.g., jealous partner, nosy neighbor, envious co-worker, insurers, criminals)
    <!-- - Who will the data be shared with? -->

> To determine whether a natural person is identifiable, account should be taken of all the means reasonably likely to be used, such as singling out, either by the controller or by another person to identify the natural person directly or indirectly.
<br /><br />
To ascertain whether means are reasonably likely to be used to identify the natural person, account should be taken of all objective factors, such as the costs of and the amount of time required for identification, taking into consideration the available technology at the time of the processing and technological developments. (Recital 26 EU GDPR)


## Metadata

- Sampling procedure (who collected the data how, when, and where)
- Dataset, e.g.,
    - Number of observations
    - Name and description of variables (including for example source of a measure, information about translation)
    - Units of measurement, coding of values (e.g., "1 = Female","2 = Male"), possible options or range in which the data points can fall (e.g., “1 = not at all to 7 = Very much”)
    - Value(s) used for missing data
    - If necessary, how a variable was derived from other variables (e.g., "`bmi` was derived from body weight `m` and height `l` as $\mathrm{BMI} = \frac{m}{l^2}$.")
- Automate codebook generation
    - Analysis software (e.g., [R `codebook` package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/codebook/index.html), [SPSS codebook function](https://libguides.library.kent.edu/SPSS/Codebooks), or [Stata codebook function](http://www.stata.com/manuals13/dcodebook.pdf))
    - Specialized software (e.g., [Nesstar](http://www.nesstar.com/software/publisher.html), [DataWiz](https://datawiz.leibniz-psychology.org/DataWiz/?datawiz_locale=en))
- If data are complex and have potentially high reuse value, consider using a standardized and machine-readable format
    - Implementation is a service provided by some repositories
    <!-- This documentation should describe the variables in each data file in both human- and machine-readable formats (e.g., csv, rather than docx or pdf).Ideally, codebooks are organized in such a way that each line represents one variable and each information relative to a variable represents a column. -->
- Can almost always be shared, even if raw or processed data cannot


## Standard operating procedures

- Describe default practices ([Lin & Green, 2016](
https://doi.org/10.1017/S1049096516000810))
- Study planning, e.g.,
    - Sample size determination
- Data analysis, e.g.,
    - Statistical models
        - Assumption tests
        - Follow-up tests
    - Exclusion criteria
    - Outlier and dropout treatment
    - Handling of missing values
    - Use of covariates
    - Corrections for multiple comparisons
- Example: [SOP for Green lab at Columbia](http://alexandercoppock.com/Green-Lab-SOP/Green_Lab_SOP.pdf)

<!-- - Simplifies authoring of preregistrations -->

<!-- https://doi.org/10.1017/S1049096516000810) -->

<!-- - **Demonstration**: Show examples (https://osf.io/rv7py/, https://osf.io/e4tqy/), show `codebook` package and [SPSS codebook function](https://libguides.library.kent.edu/SPSS/Codebooks) -->
<!-- The author of the codebook (Arslan, 2018) package for R has also created a web app for creating codebooks for SPSS, Stata or RDS files: https://rubenarslan.ocpu.io/codebook/www/ -->


## Documentation of analyses

- Exact specification of how to move from raw data to reported results (incl. data cleaning and transformation)
    - Step-by-step documentation of analyses performed in non-scriptable software programs
    - Analysis syntax
        - Avoid "works on my machine" errors (WOMME)
            - Relative file paths or load data from a permanent online source
            - Avoid spaces and special characters
            - Test on another computer
    - Set and record seeds for pseudorandom number generators
- Documentation of computational environment 
    - Hardware
    - Software version incl. extensions (e.g., R packages)
    - Cloud-based platforms (e.g., [Code Ocean](https://codeocean.com/), [RStudio cloud](https://rstudio.cloud/), [Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/))
    - Containers and virutal machines (e.g., [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/), [Singularity](https://www.sylabs.io/singularity/))
- Share intermediate results for complex analyses


## Research reports

- Paywalled publications (green open access, see Figure\ \@ref(fig:pre-post-print))
    - Preprint (initially submitted manuscript)
    - Postprint (accepted manuscript)
    - Mind journal policy (e.g., [SHERPA/RoMEO](http://www.sherpa.ac.uk/romeo/search.php), [Wikipedia list of journals by preprint policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_academic_journals_by_preprint_policy))
- Gold open access
    - Published article

```

## Planning a study

- Have a _basic_ data management plan (DMP), ideally before starting a project
    - Create basic reusable DMP templates
        - [ICPSR Framework for Creating a Data Management Plan](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/content/datamanagement/dmp/framework.html)
        - [DDC: How to Develop a Data Management and Sharing Plan](http://www.dcc.ac.uk/resources/how-guides/develop-data-plan)
    - Use online tools to get started (e.g., [ZPID DataWiz](https://datawiz.leibniz-psychology.org/DataWiz/?datawiz_locale=en), [DMPonline](https://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk/))
    - Simplifies addressing legal and ethical issues
    - Examples: [Public DMPs](https://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk/public_plans)


## Before data collection

- Timely archiving
    - Study protocol and materials
    - Standard operating procedures
    - Analysis plan and scripts
- Preregistration


## During data collection

- Born-open data ([Rouder, 2016](https://doi.org/10.3758/s13428-015-0630-z))
    - Automatically uploaded to a public repository
        - Offsite backup
        - Reduces extra sharing efforts
    - But: Protect participants' privacy!
    - Tutorial: [Born-open data with cloud storage providers](http://psych-transparency-guide.uni-koeln.de/born-open-data.html)

<!-- - **Demonstration**: Set up Dropbox to collect born-open data -->


## Upon submission

- Data, materials, and analysis scripts
    - Facilitates thorough peer-review
    - Errors can be spotted early on (no public correction)
    - Possibly limit access to reviewers prior to publications (e.g., [OSF view-only links](http://help.osf.io/m/links_forks/l/524049-create-a-view-only-link-for-a-project))
- Research report (see Figure\ \@ref(fig:pre-post-print))
    - Fast dissemination of results (citation advantage, see [Piwowar & Vision, 2013](https://peerj.com/articles/175/))
    - Public peer review
    - Establishes precedents
    - Not typically considered a "prior publication" ([Bourne, Polka, Vale, & Kiley, 2017](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005473))
        - Exceptions: For example, _New England Journal of Medicine_ and _Journal of Clinical Investigation_


## After publication

- Archive in public (or institutional) respository, publish later
    - Automate by use of embargoes
    - Reduces extra sharing efforts


# How can you share?

- Develop a default project file structure
    - See example project
        - Study protocol
        - Materials
        - Raw data
        - Processed data
        - Analyses
        - Research report

- If necessary, restrict repository access (e.g., [OSF components](http://help.osf.io/m/projects/l/481998-create-components))
    <!-- - Publicly share [encrypted files](https://medium.com/@richarddmorey/hiding-in-plain-sight-16b275b91625) -->
- Explicitly license shared products


## Study protocol

- (Embargoed) Public preregistration
    - [How to preregister via the OSF](https://osf.io/2vu7m/)
    <!-- - **Demonstration**: Show some preregistration websites, showcase good preregistrations (https://osf.io/h9k8n/) -->
- [Registered reports](https://cos.io/rr/)
- Video methods journal [JoVE Behavior](https://www.jove.com/)
    - however: relatively high publication costs (1200 - 4200 USD)


## Study material, data, & metadata

- Choose a suitable public repository (e.g., [Registry of Research Data Repositories](https://www.re3data.org/), [Meyer, 2018](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/2515245917747656?journalCode=ampa), for a more technical comparison of a selection of data repositories also see the table at the end of this [Dataverse blog post](https://dataverse.org/blog/comparative-review-various-data-repositories)
    1. Stores data in accordance with local legislation (e.g., [EU GDPR](http://www.eugdpr.org/))
    2. Persistence guarantees for long-term access
    3. Persistent and unique identifiers (e.g., DOIs)
    5. Features access controls (e.g., limit access to a select users; [GESIS secure data center](https://www.gesis.org/en/services/data-analysis/more-data-to-analyze/secure-data-center-sdc/))
    4. Supports systematic licensing (e.g., declare (no) legal restrictions on reuse)
    6. Supports structured metadata <!-- to maximize discoverability and reuse. -->
    7. Tracks reuse of shared products (e.g., citations, downloads)
- Self-deposit (e.g., [OSF](https://osf.io/)) vs. curated repositories (e.g., [GESIS DBK](https://dbk.gesis.org/dbksearch/home.asp?db=e))

<!-- - Questions for participants:  -->
<!--     - Which features of a repository would you consider important (for your data)? -->
<!--     - How would you search for a suitable repository? -->

<!-- TODO: Tabelle 1 hier unterbringen -->
<!-- TODO: Johannes, hast du noch den Link zu dem umfassenden Google Sheet?

- [FAIR Data Principles](https://www.force11.org/group/fairgroup/fairprinciples) ([Wilkinson et al., 2016](https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/sdata.2016.18))
      1. _Findable_: Persistent identifiers; metadata; indexed
      2. _Accessible_: Retrievable by identfier; controlled access where necessary
      3. _Interoperable_: Standardized metadata; open, lightweight, and interoperable file formats (e.g., CSV, TSV, JSON, ODS)
      4. _Reusable_: Documented; clear usage license

<!-- TODO: Johannes, sollten wir hier die Bewertungsdimensionen an FAIR anpassen? 
  Johannes: Da hatte ich auch drueber nachgedacht (wir hatten ja eine aehnliche Diskussion beim Schreiben des Papers), habe mich aber dagegen entschieden, weil sich FAIR ja auf Eigenschaften der Daten bezieht. Zu bewerten, ob ein Repository "Interoperable" ist, finde ich z.B. schwierig (same for "reusable"). Discoverability ist eigentlich synonym mit Findability (ich hatte mich aber bewusst fuer den anderen Begriff entschieden, damit nicht der Eindruck entsteht, dass die Kriterien hier analog zu den FAIR Princinples sind) und access control ist ein wenig so wie die Kehrseite von Accessibility.  -->

<!-- - bonus: institutional and public repositories (and in many cases also journal websites) make data citeable (usually via DOIs) -->

<!-- or add "Citeability" to the above table? Citeability <- c("-", "--", "0", "++", "++") -->


## Analysis scripts and software

- Hosted Version Control Systems (e.g., [GitHub](https://github.com/) or [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/))
- Specialized repositories
    - Cloud-based analysis platforms (e.g., [Code Ocean](https://codeocean.com/), [RStudio cloud](https://rstudio.cloud/), [Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/))
    - Cloud-based experiment platforms (e.g., [Pavlovia](https://pavlovia.org/explore) for [PsychoPy](http://www.psychopy.org/), [jspsych](https://www.jspsych.org/), and [lab.js](https://lab.js.org/))
    - Container-based experiment platforms (e.g., [The Experiment Factory](https://expfactory.github.io/))
- Usually no guarantee of long-term access


## Reports

- Prerpint repositories (e.g., [PsyArXiv](https://psyarxiv.com/), [BioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/), [PeerJ](https://peerj.com/preprints-search/))  `r recommendation`
- Institutional repositories (less discoverable)

<!-- https://nikokriegeskorte.org/2016/03/13/the-selfish-scientists-guide-to-preprint-posting/ -->


## Licenses

- Licenses define conditions of access and reuse
- Factual information (e.g., response times, mortality rates, currency values, the number of Twitter followers someone has) are usually *not* protected by copyright
    - Database structures and compilations of data may be copyrightable
    <!-- - Applying a license to noncopyrightable work does little harm -->
    
> The selection, coordination, and arrangement of the database is subject to copyright if it is sufficiently original. [...] The data or other contents contained in the database are subject to copyright if they are sufficiently creative. Original poems contained in a database would be protected by copyright, but purely factual data (such as gene names or city populations) would not. Facts are not subject to copyright, nor are the ideas underlying copyrighted content ([Creative Commons, 2018](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Data)).

- Public availability does not authorize to reuse
    - Always explicitly apply licenses
- Use easy-to-understand standard licenses (e.g., [Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/), [Open data commons](https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/))
    - For example, include a license statement in a text file ("All files in this repository are licensed under a Creative Commons Zero License (CC0 1.0)")
- Repositories may provide specialized licenses (e.g., [GESIS DBK licenses](https://dbk.gesis.org/DBKSearch/LegendAC.htm))
        <!-- - Category 0: Released for everybody -->
        <!-- - Category A: Released for academic research and teaching -->
        <!-- - Category B: Released for academic research and teaching, if the results will not be published, otherwise permission required -->
        <!-- - Category C: Released for academic research and teaching, written authorization of user and reuse intention required -->
- Use most permissive license possible
    - Ideally, reuse should only be conditioned on attribution (e.g., CC-BY)
    

### Creative Commons Licenses

- Modular license "building set" (see Table\ \@ref(tab:cc-license-modules))
    - In practice, seven combinations are supported (see Figure\ \@ref(fig:cc-licenses))
- Mind version numbers (e.g., CC-BY 4.0)
- Copyright owner can always grant exceptions
- Copyright to long verbatim interview responses may belong to participants

```{r cc-license-modules, echo = FALSE}

<!-- ODbL - Attribution, share-alike (vgl. CC-BY-SA) -->


<!-- The ODC licenses apply only to sui generis database rights and any copyright in the database structure, they do not apply to the individual contents of the database. The latest version of the CC licenses on the other hand apply to sui generis database rights and all copyright and neighboring rights in the database structure as well as the contents. -->

<!-- Another important difference is that ODC licenses may create contractual obligations even in jurisdictions where database rights would not otherwise exist and but for the license permission would not be necessary. CC has crafted its licenses to ensure that they never impose obligations where permission is not otherwise required to use the licensed material. -->

# How you can promote openness?

## Incentivize sharing

- Lead by example
    - Promote practical advantages for researchers (find your own data, more citations...)
    - [Commitment to Research Transparency and Open Science](http://www.researchtransparency.org/)
- Emphasize openness during peer review
    - [PRO initiative](https://opennessinitiative.org/)


## How can you promote research transparency?

- use templates for transparent & reproducible projects
- share materials with your collaborators
- teach your students and colleagues
    - What do we do here in Cologne?
    - Example: Registered Report draft as non-empirical Bachelor's thesis
- vote with you feet
    - Choose journals that value openness/robustness
- Incentives
    - Take openess into account when particpating in commissions (https://osf.io/7jbnt/)
- Give credit where credit is due (cite data, open source software developed by academics, etc.)


## Why not to share?

- Privacy/Sensitive data
    - Get informed consent from participants
    - Properly anonymize/pseudonymize data
    - Employ access control
- Scooping
    - Usually an unwarranted fear
    - Publish upon acceptance or with an embargo
- I could be wrong
    - Errors are inevitable

    - Open science == good research management practices
        - Increases efficency in the long-run

> … until recently I was an open-data hypocrite. Although I was committed to open data, I was not implementing it in practice. … Some of it was a lack of effort. It was a pain to document the data; it was a pain to format the data; it was a pain to contact the library personnel; it was a pain to figure out which data were indeed published as part of which experiments. Some of it was forgetfulness. I had neither a routine nor any daily incentive to archive data [Rouder, 2016, p. 1063](https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758%2Fs13428-015-0630-z)
